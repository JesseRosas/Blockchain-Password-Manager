# Blockchain-Password-Manager

The goal of this project is to develop a password manager that allows users to securely store and manage login credentials using the blockchain. Traditional password managers store data on centralized servers, which can become targets for data breaches. Our system will instead use smart contracts to store credential data on a blockchain. This allows users to maintain control of their data through their crypto wallet. By removing centralized storage and relying on blockchain verification, our system aims to improve transparency, security, and user ownership of sensitive information.

### Users:
* Users who want to securely store and manage their passwords online using a blockchain
* Users that want a decentralized storage application
* Users that are familiar with crypto wallets

### Tasks:
* **Connect** their crypto wallet to authenticate with the application
* **Add** new login credentials (username and password)
* **Store** credentials on the blockchain
* **View** a list of saved credentials
* **Retrieve** stored passwords locally
* **Delete** credentials they no longer need
